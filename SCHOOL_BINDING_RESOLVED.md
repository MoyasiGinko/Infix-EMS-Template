# âœ… School Binding Error - RESOLVED!

## Problem Summary

**Error:** `Target class [school] does not exist.`

This error occurred because Laravel's service container was trying to resolve a `school` binding that wasn't properly established during middleware execution.

## Root Cause

The `SaasSchool()` function was attempting to call `app('school')` before the school was properly bound to the Laravel service container, creating a circular dependency issue.

## âœ… Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed SaasSchool() Function

**File:** `app/Helpers/Helper.php`

- Modified the school binding logic to prevent circular dependencies
- Added proper checks for existing bindings before attempting to resolve
- Ensured school is always bound to the container when the function is called

### 2. Fixed AppServiceProvider Bindings

**File:** `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

- Added safety checks to all service bindings that depend on `app('school')`
- Protected view composers with `app()->bound('school')` checks
- Prevented early binding resolution before school is established

### 3. Specific Changes Made:

#### Helper.php Changes:

```php
// Before: Circular dependency issue
if (app()->bound('school')) {
    return app('school');
} else {
    app()->instance('school', $school);
}

// After: Safe binding
if (!app()->bound('school')) {
    app()->instance('school', $school);
} else {
    app()->forgetInstance('school');
    app()->instance('school', $school);
}
```

#### AppServiceProvider.php Changes:

- `dashboard_bg` binding: Added school binding check
- View composers: Added `app()->bound('school')` guards
- Plugin bindings: Protected with school availability checks
